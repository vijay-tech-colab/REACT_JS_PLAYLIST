# React Journey

Welcome to my **React Journey** repository! This is where I document everything I learn while exploring React. From beginner to advanced concepts, I'll be adding tutorials, code snippets, challenges, and full projects along the way.

## üöÄ What to Expect
- **Hands-on projects** that showcase the concepts learned.
- **Code snippets** for quick reference and practice.
- **Challenges** to push myself further with React.
- **Notes and resources** that I find helpful throughout my learning process.

## üìö Topics Covered
- **Introduction to React**
- **Functional Components & Class Components**
- **State and Props**
- **React Hooks**  
  - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`
  - Custom hooks
- **Component Lifecycle**
- **React Router** (for client-side routing)
- **State Management**
  - **Context API**
  - **Redux** (Thunk, Toolkit)
  - **React Query** (for managing server state)
  - **Recoil**, **Zustand**, **XState** (alternative state management libraries)
- **Forms and Validation** (with `formik`, `react-hook-form`, etc.)
- **Styling in React**  
  - CSS Modules, Styled-Components, Emotion
  - Tailwind CSS
- **React Performance Optimization**  
  - `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
  - Lazy loading components, code-splitting
- **React Patterns**  
  - Higher Order Components (HOCs), Render Props, Compound Components
  - Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
- **React Query**  
  - Fetching data, Caching, and Synchronization of server data
  - Pagination and Infinite Scrolling with React Query
  - Mutations and Optimistic Updates
  - Query Invalidation and Refetching
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with **Next.js**
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with **Next.js**
- **TypeScript** with React

## üí° Learning Methodology
- Start with the basics and build upon them.
- Learn by doing: I will implement features as I go along.
- Reference the official [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) whenever I need clarification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **React** (Core)
- **React Router** (for navigation)
- **React Query** (for fetching and caching server data)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **TypeScript** (for static typing)
- **Node.js** (for API integration)
- **Redux / Context API** (for state management)
- **Styled Components** (for styling)
- **Jest** / **React Testing Library** / **Cypress** (for testing)
- **Next.js** (for SSR/SSG)

## üéØ Goals
- Master the fundamentals of React and its ecosystem.
- Build a collection of useful React projects.
- Experiment with new React features and third-party libraries.
- Gain expertise in server state management with **React Query**.
- Understand and implement state management solutions (like Redux, React Query, and Context API).

## üå± Next Steps
- Continue exploring advanced React patterns (e.g., hooks, compound components, context for global state).
- Learn and implement **React Query** for better data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Dive deeper into **Next.js** for SSR/SSG and other server-side capabilities.
- Master testing strategies with **React Testing Library** and **Cypress**.
- Build production-ready apps with **React Native** for mobile development.

## ü§ù How You Can Help
- Give suggestions on better practices or libraries.
- Contribute to the code or open issues if you find something interesting.
- Share helpful resources, tutorials, or challenges.
